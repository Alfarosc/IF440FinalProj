# IF440 Artificial Intelligence Final Project

## Description
This project is a final project for IF440 Artificial Intelligence course. The project is about implementing genetic algorithm works on face recognition program. The Genetic Algorithm program is implemented using Python 3.6.5 and the face recognition program is implemented using OpenCV. [GeneticAlgorithm.ipynb](GeneticAlgorithm.ipynb) is the Genetic Algorithm program of the project. Result Journal of the project can be found in [Journal.pdf](Journal.pdf).
